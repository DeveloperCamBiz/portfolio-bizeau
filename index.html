      <h2>Welcome Everyone!</h2>
      <p>
        I'm creating this site as a way to test the skills that I am learning
        in my software development program at Correlation One.  It will showcase 
        information about myself as well as everything that I am learning on this journey.<br><br>
        This site will contain sections about me as well as blog about what I'm currently learning.
        I'll also add an area at the bottom to leave some contact info as well as some
        comments on what I can improve.
        Thank you for stopping by and seeing what I'm up to!

      <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Cameron Bizeau and I am so excited to be taking this 
          software developement journey! I graduated from UC Davis with with 
          a Bachelor's degree that double majored in Mathematics and Psychology. 
          I hope that though this program at Correlation One that I can develop 
          my skillset enough to break into the software development industry. <br><br>
          Feel free to check out my 
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cameron.bizeau/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>
          for now, and I will also add a LinkedIn page once it's set up!

      <h2>The Current Stop of My Software Development Journey - Advanced CSS!</h2>
      <p>
        Right now we are learning more advanced CSS properties, and I have to say that it is by far
        my favorite thing that we have covered!  It's really cool to be able to style our webpages in 
        ways that look more pleasing and makes the progress of what we are learning look very 
        tangible.  In addition to grids, I now added some transitions to the page as well as some psuedo elements to the links and comment box.  I also added a media query to take out the animations for anyone who prefers reduced motion.<br><br>
        That being said, I do think that we are starting to get into stuff that is a little more difficult
        to understand.  But that just means that I'll have to work even harder to meet my end goal and reach
        the finish line of this program with everyone else!
